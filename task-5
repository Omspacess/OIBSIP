      <p>
        Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, fondly remembered as the "Missile Man of India", was not only a brilliant scientist but also a humble, visionary leader. His journey from a small town in Rameswaram to becoming the 11th President of India is a testament to hard work, dedication, and passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I admire most in him is his unwavering commitment to education and youth empowerment. He believed in dreaming big and encouraged every student to pursue their passion with sincerity and integrity.
      </p>

      <p>
        His speeches were full of wisdom and simplicity. One quote that always inspires me is: <span class="highlight">"Dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let you sleep."</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        I adore his kindness, his smile, and his dedication to science and nation-building. His legacy continues to ignite young minds even today, reminding us that no dream is too big if we work towards it sincerely.
